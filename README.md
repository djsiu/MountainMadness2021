## What our web application does

- A typing test with an interrupting chicken
- Every time you make a typo you are interrupted with a chicken and a prompt to type the chicken-related word that pops up (note: you must click on the text box to type the chicken-related word just to be extra disruptive)
- Option (recommended) to play some relaxing music while you do the typing test
